# Jira

Jira is a task-managing system, similar to something like GitHub issues.

It's the industry standard for Software Development workflows, and can be used to manage very large or small tasks effectively.

## Agile

Agile is a workflow system based on 2 week long 'sprints'. 

It's very effective to implement these into Jira using Backlog feature.

## Issues

Issues are not synonymous with 'problems' in this case. Similar to GitHub issues, it again means a thing that needs to be worked on. There are multiple types of issues in Jira:
### Epic

Epics are big groups of Stories. Think of implementing a large feature that involves multiple sub-features. E.g., implementing an auto-engine sequencing for starting a car engine.

### Story

Stories are groupings of tasks, things that take a while but not as long as an Epic. 

So, essentially, imagine you have to move your DevOps from Jenkins to GitHub actions. That would be an Epic, and then the smaller part of that—using Bazel as the new build system—would be a Story, which would then be composed of mini-tasks for each CI workflow.

### Task

Tasks are exactly how they sound, just a task. They should be *very specific, iterable*, and be able to be done quickly.

### Bug

Bugs are exactly what they are in software. An actual *problem* with the code, something that needs to be fixed for the program to function properly.

There can be different levels to these.
