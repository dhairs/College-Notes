## Overview

A **dependence relation** is a closed form expression that gives all dependences for a given loop nest, not just a yes or no for the existence of a dependence. This can be calculated using an ILP calculator but is often too expensive to compute for most programs.

A **dependence abstraction** is a: 
- Distance vector
- Direction vector
- Dependence matrix
