## Dry Friction â€” Coulomb Friction

One solid point-surface against another. Depending on the situation, Coulomb friction can:
- hold an object in equilibrium (static friction)
- slow down the motion (kinetic friction)

$F_{f} \leq \mu F_{n}$

### Phases of Coulomb Friction


## Friction in Grasping: Point on Plane Contact

Three options for this:
- Frictionless: only normal force is transmitted (picking up from under)
- With Friction: Normal and tangential force is transmitted, but $F=\{f \;|\; ||f_{\text{tangent}}||\leq \mu_{s}||f_{\text{normal}}||,f_{z}\geq_{0}\}$
- Soft finger contact: Normal and tangential forces are transmitted, and torques are too, but $F=\{(f,\tau_{\text{normal}})\; |\; || f_{\text{tangent}}||\leq \mu_{s} ||f_{\text{normal}}||,f_{z}\geq 0, |\tau_{\text{normal}}|\leq \gamma f_{z} \}$

## Friction Cone

Each normal force is associated to a maximum tangential force (given by the static friction parameter). Geometrically, this gives form to a cone. The angle of the cone is given by $\tan^{-1}$

## Defining a Grasp

Each contact point creates a force/wrench. 

**Grasp**: the combination of all applied forces/wrenches.

A **grasp set** corresponds to all possible sets of wrenches that can be used to grasp the object. If the grasp space is large, the grasp is very robust to disturbances.
