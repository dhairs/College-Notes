## Definition
A **differential equation (DE**) is any equation in which the unknown is a function.

A DE always includes derivatives of the function.

The **order** of a DE is the highest derivative that appears.

Will only go over one independent variable DE's in this course, typically with variable $t$ (time).

### Example
$$
\frac{dy}{dt}=y^2+t^2
$$
This DE has **order 1**, or it is of the **first-order**.

That is the same with $y'=y$.

### Example 
$$
\frac{d^2y}{dt^2}+y\frac{dy}{dt}+(\frac{dy}{dt})^{10}=0
$$

The first section ($\frac{d^2y}{dt^2}$) has the highest order, which is 2, so this DE has an **order of 2**.
