## SIR Model Definition

$S(t)$ is the number of susceptible individuals
$I(t)$ is the number of infected individuals
$R(t)$ is the number of recovered individuals

Our model of disease spread in S, I, and R is nonlinear:

$\frac{d}{dt}S=-\alpha SI$

$\frac{d}{dt}I=\alpha SI-\gamma I$

$\frac{d}{dt}R = \gamma I$
