spend more time on the model overtview for kernel bench

explain fuzzing

explain fast p better: fraction of programs that are faster than p and are correct

explain the anoma.y for fastp on the one shot

they already know the gpucc stuff, don't need to present

remove second paper, extend first paper and more charts instead of tables â€” simplify fast -p


change the example given to the model in context 

use the matrix multiply examples dr. pingali will give us

go through with in context increasing the optimization in the input after getting a smaller optimization correct

compare cublas, pytorch, llm

go over the newest
