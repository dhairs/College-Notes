## Device Level

Recall the basic organization of a DRAM device, from the [[Main Memory]] lecture.

Bits of data are stored on a 1T1C (1 transistor 1 capacitor) cell. The capacitance is extremely small, about 20 femto farads. There is parasitic resistance, so slowly the capacitor will leak and discharge. For this reason, the capacitor must also be periodically refreshed, the interval of which is directly proportional to temperature.
