### Where did you grow up?

I grew up in Plymouth, Minnesota, so the opposite end of the country (vertically)!

### What high school did you attend?

I attended Wayzata High School.

### What was your favorite extracurricular activity in high school?

My favorite was soccer, but I also enjoyed debate and robotics.

### Where would you have gone if UT hadn't accepted you?

I would have gone to UIUC or UW Madison instead.

### What would you have majored in if CS hadn't accepted you?

Electrical and Computer Engineering, I really enjoy working on stuff that is closer to the hardware.

### Why are you in this class?

I wanted to learn more about C++. I have had some encounters with it in clubs or in working on embedded firmware, but I've never really been able to understand a lot of the things I read.

### What are your expectations of this class?

I'm looking forward to learning more about C++ so that I can apply it in future projects or even in industry one day. I think having a strong understanding of it will be important for me in the future.

### How much C/C++ do you already know?

I know quite a bit of C because of using it in 429 and 439 as well as in clubs, but with C++ I've had to self-learn and haven't gotten any formal understanding of the language. I've used it in clubs but never exhaustively or thoroughly.

### How did you like the first lectures?

I don't like not being able to take notes myself and the cold calling, but otherwise the content seems interesting.

### How did you feel about the cold calling?

Not a huge fan of it, but I can see how it could be helpful in understanding material.

### What made you happy this week?

Hanging out with my friends and playing football.

### What's your **pick-of-the-week** or **tip-of-the-week**?

My pick of the week is build systems! I learned Bazel and how it enables multi-language projects very efficiently—also how it can make sure the code builds on everyone's machine. I was able to make a C++ and Rust [project](https://link.guptadhairya.com/lhre) with it recently and think its a really cool thing to use if you want to figure out how build systems work.
