## 1D Linear Regression

**Task**: Predict output $y \in \mathbb{R}$ from a single input $x \in \mathbb{R}$
- A linear model is of the form $y=wx+b$
- The parameters are $w, b$ and they define a **family** of lines
	- $w$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept

**Training Set**: Can be represented as $\{(x_{i},y_{i})\}^n_{i=1}$

**Loss**: Can be represented as $L=\Sigma^n_{i=1}()$
