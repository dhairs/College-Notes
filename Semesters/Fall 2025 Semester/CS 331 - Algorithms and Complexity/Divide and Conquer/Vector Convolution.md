## Problem

Let $u=(u_{0},\dots,u_{m-1})$ and $v=(v-,\dots,v_{n-1})$ be vectors of length $m$ and $n$ respectively. The convolution of $u$ and $v$, denoted as $u * v$ is a vector of length $m+n-1$ with component $k,0\leq k\leq m\leq n$

### Polynomial Multiplication



$3y''+5y'+y=7x$

find transfer function, poles + zeros, ODE gain/DC gain, impulse/step response, time to reach percentage of final value.
