## What is Conditional Probability?

In essence, conditional probability is for when an event has already happened, and we want to model what comes next.

Examples: 
- It is cloudy and might rain
- Given that you are a felon, probability that you go to college
- Given that you were accepted to college, probability that you receive a scholarship
- Given that you are registered to vote, probability to vote

Similar to a heuristic (you know one thing, how can you predict the next).

Looking into conditional probability is also important to understand the *[independence](Independence.md)* of events. It seems backwards, but if you know the probability of something happened based on something else, you can find if there is a correlation or probability increase.

This causes us to ask these two questions:
- Are two events actually related?
- Does knowing one tell us nothing about the other?
