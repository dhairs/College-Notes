## Representing Programs

Remember the compilation process:

The LD stands for the Linkage eDitor, and outputs executable

## Types of Object Files

An object file is a *self-describing* block of bytes

This is similar to storing the tree in the header of a Huffman encoded file, or the metadata for a [[Dynamic Memory Management|malloc]] memory block.

There are three types:
- **Relocatable**: Binary code and data, suitable for combining (e.g. `p1.o` and `p2.o`)
- **Shared**: A special type of relocatable object file that can be loaded into memory and linked dynamically, either at load time or at run time (the file `libc.so`)
	- Note: this is what as `.dll` is on Windows
- **Executable**: Binary code and data, suitable for being copied into memory and executed (e.g. the file `p`)

### Object File Formats

Different formats on different systems:
- UNIX (originally): `a.out`
- Windows: Portable Executable (PE)
- MacOS-X: Mach Object (Mach-O)
- AArch64/Linux: Executable and Linkable Format (ELF)
	- We will discuss this one in depth

Fat binary: Multiple formats combined into one, which allows the binary to run on multiple systems

### ELF Format

The header is stored in 16 bytes, and it contains all the necessary information to bootstrap the file and run it.

All sections are variable-length.

#### Example

##### Source Files:

```c main.c
int sum(int *a, int n);

int array[2] = {1, 2};

int main(void) {
	int val = sum(array, 2);
	return val;
}
```

- The interface of `sum` is declared
- `sum` is *defined* elsewhere
- `sum`is called (referenced)

```c sum.c
int sum(int *a, int n) {
	int i, s = 0;
	for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
		s += a[i];
	return s;
}
```

- The implementation of `sum` is defined
- The definition of `sum` happens to match the signature of the interface declared in `main.c`

##### What would happen with different function signatures?

What if `sum` had a function signature of `int sum(int *a, int *b, int n)`?

There would be no issues with compilation, because type information is lost once we compile into a `.o` file. We simply have our assembly code, which contains nothing relating to types or function signature, we just have the name.

C++ solves this by "mangling" the name, and adding type information to the function name itself. This is especially important for function overloading.

#### Takeaways

The linker is not concerned with handing local variables and other symbols that are not visible outside individual object modules (static).

A module's **symbol table** provides information about the externally visible symbols defined in that module and the external symbols referenced by the module.
- These definitions and references must be matched, this process is called **symbol resolution**

The **relocation entries** of a module provide information about which symbol references in that module need to be adjusted (and how) when combining multiple object modules.
- Each object module is generated in isolation, in its local coordinate system
- We need to keep track of where to put each module, and put them into a single, global coordinate system for the final executable. We move code to new locations (hence "relocation")
- References must be connected to their resolved definitions, this is called **patching**

A variety of violations are detected by the linker, but not all conditions can be caught (e.g., different function signatures)
