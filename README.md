# College Notes

My notes over the course of college, best viewed on [Obsidian](https://www.obsidian.md).

To view these notes, download Obsidian, and Git clone this repository. 

Run Obsidian and click `File > Open Vault`, or click the little vault icon in the bottom left corner. Then, just select the folder you cloned this repository into. 

If you for some reason don't want to use Obsidian, you can browse them on GitHub but note that certain expressions in LaTeX won't render properly, and you won't be able to see links to other files.

# A step further
## Desktop

If you want the repository to automatically download on an interval to stay up-to-date, make sure you have `git` installed on your computer.

Go to Obsidian settings and enable community plugins, then, install Obsidian Git.

Configure the settings however you like, it should use the folder's `git` settings.

## iOS

If you want to take it a step further and enable auto updating of the repository on an iPad or iPhone, download [Working Copy](https://workingcopy.app/), and either buy a subscription or get the student free version using [these](https://workingcopy.app/education/) instructions.

Then, go to your iOS Shortcuts app and set an automation to run when you open Obsidian. Have it run a fetch and pull using Working Copy.
