## General Bonding (Chapter 8)

### This unit is largely conceptual, so make sure you understand the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">why</span> behind the concepts.

It‚Äôs important to know what exactly we mean when we say **chemical bonds **in this chapter. In simple terms; a chemical bond is a force of attraction between 2 atoms or a group of atoms

   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
<h4><strong>Increases</strong> as you go across rows</h4>

This is explained by the increasing Z<sub>eff</sub> (Shielding electrons are constant, but protons increase, so the valence electrons are pulled in tighter, causing a smaller atomic radius). More nuclear charge and smaller atomic radius means the atom is able to pull on another atom‚Äôs valence electron <strong>more effectively</strong>.
   </td>
   <td>
<h4><strong>Decreases</strong> as you go down columns</h4>

This is explained by the constant Z<sub>eff</sub> (radius is increasing so less pull outside the atom). The larger radius means the atom pulls on another atom‚Äôs valence electron <strong>less effectively.</strong>

   <td><strong>Step 1. </strong>
<p>
Draw the structure of the compound itself, draw single bonds to start. Count the number of valence electrons for all the elements in the compound (eg, CH4 would be 4 (C) +4*1 (H): 8 electrons)
   </td>
   <td><strong>Step 2.</strong>
<p>
Subtract the number of bonded electrons from the valence electrons--that is, subtract 2 from the valence electrons for every 1 bond(s).
   </td>
   <td><strong>Step 3.</strong>
<p>
If you <strong>need</strong> <strong>more </strong>electrons than valence electrons available to fill the shells of the atoms, form a double bond for every 2 missing electrons. 
<p>
If you <strong>have</strong> <strong>extra </strong>electron <strong>pairs</strong>, place them on the central atom, this molecule isn‚Äôt following the <strong>octet rule</strong>, and have an <strong>expanded octet. </strong>(expanded octets use empty <strong>D orbitals</strong>)
<p>
If you have an <strong>odd number </strong>of electrons, one atom gets<strong> 7 electrons</strong>. (Groups II and III usually are odd)

The VSEPR Model - Video
Electron groups are a non-bonded pair of electrons or a bonded atom (single, double, and triple bonds all count as 1 electron group)
Electron groups try to stay as far from each other as possible, they repel each other
Note: lone pairs usually take more room than bonded pairs, but we don't need to know more

## Answers to Practice Problems (w/ Explanations)



1.  Determine which of the following bonds is more polar using only Periodic Trends: 
    1. **Mg-O **is more polar; we know that** [electronegativity](#heading=h.n66n64syatgk) increases** as we **go [across a period](#heading=h.xc00pkoyq0xv)** (row) and **[decreases down a group](#heading=h.j0m2glpg713)** (column). Since **O** is in both bonds, we can ignore it‚Äôs electronegativity and look at the others. **Be** is higher than **Mg** in the same group, so it must have a higher electronegativity, this means the electronegativities of **O** and **Be** are more similar than that of **Mg **and **O**, so the electrons spend less time with a specific atom in **Be-O** than they do in **Mg-O. **When asked for which is more polar, essentially you‚Äôre looking for the compound in which the electron spends more time with a certain atom.
    2. **K-Cl**, they‚Äôre on different periods + further apart in terms of columns.
    3. **Sr-S**, they‚Äôre further apart.
    4. Hard to tell; not really discernable with periodic trends without knowing actual #‚Äôs
2. Draw the Lewis Structures (and any Resonance structures) for the following molecules (understand this by clicking [here](#heading=h.evc0qceucr19)):
