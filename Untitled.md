Hi!

tl;dr: cool updates to Discord bot! [Add here.](https://discord.com/application-directory/716684679217938592). [Code here](https://www.github.com/epicnd/scoultimate-discord-bot). [Feedback here](https://discord.gg/hUYqUHm)

A few years ago, a friend and I released a Discord bot called Scoultimate. We had stopped maintaining it and let it run on its own for the past ~2.5 years, but then Discord changed how commands worked. 

As a result, we decided to completely rewrite the bot to work with discord’s new slash commands and utilize the new features on the platform. 

Introducing Scoultimate v2 (this time it’s [open source](https://www.github.com/epicnd/scoultimate-discord-bot))

We’re still rebuilding a lot of the functionality, but we’ve made it open source in hopes of allowing the community to request and add features they’d like, as well as ensuring that everyone feels comfortable using the bot. 

The biggest update our bot has this time around is the ability to send **notifications**, we currently support **Upcoming Match** and **Match Score** TBA webhooks. We're slowly expanding this functionality to include other types of webhook notifications.

Additionally, we're now in college so our time is much more limited when it comes to adding new features or updating the bot, and open-sourcing the bot allows for it to stay maintainable for when we aren't able to work on it.

If you want to add the bot to your own server to give it a spin, here’s the [link to add it](https://discord.com/application-directory/716684679217938592). If you'd like to contribute to the bot, please feel free to do so on our open source repo linked above! And finally, if you have feedback you want to send directly, please do so through our [community Discord server](https://discord.gg/hUYqUHm).

Please let me know if there’s any feedback or questions. And as always, feel free to share the bot with others!

Thanks!
