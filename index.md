They are from college, you can see them using the sidebar on the left.

You can find my notes for classes in `Semesters > [Semester] > [Course #/Name]`. 

Most notes will have connections to other notes, you can see those on the right with the graph view. The graph is automatically populated based on what notes link to the note you're currently viewing, as well as outbound links. Links are highlighted, so make sure to click around to see all the notes!
