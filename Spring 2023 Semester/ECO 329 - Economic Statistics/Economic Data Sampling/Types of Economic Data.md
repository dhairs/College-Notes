## Cross Sectional Data

Spacial variation.

Observations on different units (individuals, households, firms, countries, etc.) measured at the *same point in time* or within the same time interval.

**Example**:
- Data for individuals on labor force status, earnings, hours worked, etc.
- Data for firms on profits, R&D expenditures, patents awarded, etc.

## Time-Series Data

Time variation.

Observations on the same unit measured at different points in time.

**Example**:
- Annual data for the U.S. on unemployment rate, inflation, GDP growth, budget deficit, etc.
- Daily returns and/or prices for a given stock or other financial asset

## Panel Data

Both spacial and time variation.

Data with both a cross-section dimension and a time-series dimension.

In economics, you want to have panel data because you are able to use a lot more econometric tools to estimate the true effects of things.

**Example**:
- Annual data for all 50 states on smoking rates and cigarette taxes
- Monthly data for all 50 states on influenza vaccination rates, deaths caused by influenza, and hospitalizations caused by influenza
- Annual data for many countries on unemployment rate, inflation rate, and GDP growth
- Data on all facility emissions in the US for 50 years, data on mortality per county for 50 years
