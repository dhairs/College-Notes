## Anatomy of a Disk
Disks are made up of circular surfaces called "platters." The surface of these platters contain a large number of concentric **tracks**, which are each divided up into **sectors** divided by gaps. A sector is the smallest unit of data that can be read from or written to a disk. A **cylinder** is a collection of tracks on multiple surfaces that are located at the same radius. 

Early HDDs needed the physical address of a sector to be specified in the cylinder-head-sector (CHS) scheme. To a modern operating system, the HDD is a collection of logical sectors.
