## Dynamic Ram (DRAM)

DRAM cells have a structure of 1 transistor and 1 capacitor. In DRAM, the two states are signified by the presence (or absence) of trapped charge on the capacitor.

The [[Bits and Bit Technologies#^e5350b|MOSFET]] is the control when storing charge when writing, and also senses the presence of charge in reading. However, these capacitors discharge over time and require periodic refreshes to maintain state.

For this reason, the DRAM cell is sensitive to noise and leakage, and is not persistent, but can handle **many many** read and write cycles without breaking.

## Single In-line Memory Modules (SIMMs) and Dual In-line Memory Modules (DIMMs)

Typical computers have 2-4 DIMMs on the motherboard.
