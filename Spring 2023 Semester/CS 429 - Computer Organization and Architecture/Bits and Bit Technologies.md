**BIT** - **BI**nary digi**T**

A bit is an 'entity' having *two* distinct, *distinguishable*, *discrete* states. Generically designated as $\circ$ and $|$.

A bit can be realized by any physical object that has two stable states that can be distinguished confidently.  
- Think of a transistor's on and off state â€” when passing current, the bit is $|$, when no current, the bit is $\circ$
- Additionally, think of a CAN bus, there is no off or on state, but rather a low and high voltage to differentiate. One line runs usually at 2.5v and the other usually around 5v, differences between both wires can be interpreted as $|$ or $\circ$ because they are predictable and stable.
