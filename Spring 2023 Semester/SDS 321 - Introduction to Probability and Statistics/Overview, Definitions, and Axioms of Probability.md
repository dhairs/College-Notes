## What is Probability?

Can be defined as the likelihood of an outcome occurring. **Alternatively**, it can be defined as the proportion of times an event will occur if the experiment is repeated over and over again under the same conditions. 

Written as $\frac{\text{num. of favorable outcomes}}{\text{num. of total possible outcomes}}$

Easiest to be understood in a few examples:

### Ex: Imagine a coin flip 🪙

There are two equally likely outcomes: heads or tails (assuming the coin doesn't land on its edge)

Therefore, both have a likelihood of $\frac{1}{2}=0.5$


### Ex: Imagine rolling a die 🎲

There are 6 possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

Therefore, the probability of rolling a 2 is: $\frac{1}{6}$

However, the probability of rolling an even number is $\frac{3}{6}$ because there are 3 possible even numbers, and 6 possible total numbers.

## What is an Experiment and Event

- A **random experiment** is a process that can have more than one possible outcome, where the outcome itself depends on chance and cannot be specified ahead of time.
- An **event** is an outcome or a set of outcomes of an experiment.


## What is Sample Space?
- The sample space ($\Omega$) is the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment.
- The different elements of a sample space must be distinct, [[#Mutually Exclusive Events|mutually exclusive]], and collectively exhaustive.

### Mutually Exclusive Events
Events that cannot occur at the same time. If one occurs, it excludes the other from occurring.

### Ex: What is the sample space for each of the following:
