## Bar Charts for Categorical Variables

Recall the definition of [[Variables#Categorical Variables|Categorical Variables]].

Consider a categorical variable $x$, with sample $\{x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_3\}$, where there are a total of C possible categories for $x$. Assume that the categories are disjoint and exhaustive.

The **sample count** for category $c$ is the number of observations in $c$:

$$
\text{sample count for } c=\sum^n_{i=1}1(x_i=c)
$$

The **sample proportion** for categorical variable $x$ associated with category $c$ is the fraction or percentage of observations in $c$:

$$
\text{sample proportion for } c=\frac{\sum^n_{i=1}1(x_i=c)}{n} = \frac{1}{n}\sum^n_{i=1}1(x_i=c)
$$

Note: **The sum of sample proportions is always 1**.

## Histograms for Discrete and Continuous Variables

Recall the definitions for [[Variables#Discrete Variable|Discrete Variables]] and [[Variables#Continuous Variable|Continuous Variables]].

With histograms, we can visualize the sample distribution of variables.

## Measures of Location

The **sample mean** of observations $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ denoted $\overline{x}$ is given by:

$$
\overline{x} = \frac{x_1+x_2+\ldots+x_n}{n}=\frac{1}{n}\sum^n_{i=1}x_i
$$

The **sample median** of observations $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ is denoted ${\tilde{x}_{1/2}}$ is the value for which half the observations are below and half are above.
