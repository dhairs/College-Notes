## Statistical Independence

If knowing $B$ doesn't give you any information to the probability of $A$ occurring, then $A$ and $B$ are **independent**.

Thus: 

$$\text{if}\; P(A|B)=P(A)$$
The events $A$ and $B$ are independent.


$A$ and $B$ are independent $\text{iff}\; P(A\cap B)=P(A)P(B)$

If the events $A$ and $B$ are independent, $P(A|B^\complement)=P(A)$ 

### Checking for Independence
#### Method 1
Check $P(A|B)=P(A)$ or $P(B|A)=P(B)$
#### Method 2
Check $P(A\cap B)=P(A)\,P(B)$
## Statistical Dependence

If knowing $B$ provides some information on the probability of $A$ occurring, then $A$ and $B$ are **dependent**.

Thus:

$$\text{if}\; P(A|B)\neq P(A)$$
The events $A$ and $B$ are dependent.
