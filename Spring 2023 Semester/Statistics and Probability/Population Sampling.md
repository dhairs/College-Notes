## The Population and Sampling

The population is the entire group for which we want to draw conclusions using statistical analysis.

The **sample** consists of the specific units from the population for which we collect and observe data

## Random Sampling

A sample of size $n$ is a **simple random sample** if each element of the population is equally likely to be sampled, or, that any possible sample of size $n$ is equally likely to be chosen

### Sampling Bias

When the sample is not a simple random sample, it may introduce **sampling bias**
