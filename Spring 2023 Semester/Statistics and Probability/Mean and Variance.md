## Population Mean and Population Variance

Recall that for a discrete random variable $X$, with possible outcomes $\{x^*_k\}^K_{k=1}$, where $K$ can be finite or countably infinite

The population **mean** of a continuous random variable $X$, denoted $\mu_X$ or $E(X)$ is given by:

$$\mu_X = E(X) = \int^\infty_{-\infty}xf_X(x)dx$$

Recall that for a discrete random variable $X$:

$$\sigma^2_X=\text{Var}(X)=E[(X-\mu_X)^2]=\int^\infty_{-\infty}($$
