# Definition

Including the case when events are *not* independent, joint probabilities can be determined by **successive conditioning**.

In the case of two events:

$$P(A_1\cap A_2)=P(A_1)\,P(A_2|A_1)$$

In the case of three events:

$$P(A_1\cap A_2\cap A_3)=P(A_1)\,P(A_2|A_1)\,P(A_3|A_2,A_1)$$

And so on...

*Note* that you can choose the order of the events, does not have to be exactly as listed above.
