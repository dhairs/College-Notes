## Product Rule for Ordered Pairs

If there are $m$ choices for the first action and $n$ choices for the second action, the number of possible choices for both actions is $mn$.

## General Product Rule

Suppose there are $k$ actions, if there are $n_1$ choices for the 1st action, $n_2$ choices for the 2nd action, and so on through $n_k$ actions for the $k$-th action, the number of possible choices for the $k$ actions is given by the product of the number of choices, which is $n_1 n_2 \ldots n_k$,

## Ex: Company Retirement Plan
8 different bond funds and 12 different stock funds. 
- For your portfolio, you are allowed to pick one bond fund and one stock fund
How many possible ways are there to pick a portfolio?
$$=8\times12=96$$
