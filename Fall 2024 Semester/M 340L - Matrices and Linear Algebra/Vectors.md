## Definition

A vector is a list of *real* numbers.

### Example

$$
\bar{v}=[1], (1,2,3)
$$

Elements are 1-indexed, and for column (vertical) vectors, the topmost value is 1st, for row (horizontal) vectors, the leftmost value is 1st.

In this class, $\bar{}$  is the notation for a vector.

## Notation

$\text{R}^2$ is the set of all vectors of size 2.
***
$\text{R}^n$ is the set of all vectors of size $n$.

### Example

$$
\bar{0}=\begin{bmatrix}
0 \\
0 \\
\vdots \\
0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

This is a zero vector, all entries in it are zeroes.

## Interpretations of Vectors

1. List of numbers
2. Point
	1. Ex. a vector of size 2 can be interpreted as coordinate points in a 2-dimensional plane.
	2. $n$ size vectors can be used to represent $n$-dimensional space/planes.
3. Arrow (*note that different arrows may represent the same vector*)
