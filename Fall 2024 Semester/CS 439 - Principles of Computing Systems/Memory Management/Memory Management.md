## Purpose

Memory management has three key tasks:
- **Enable** programmers to use memory
- **Protect** programs from one another
- **Manage** the physical resources efficiently

Because this is the piece that programs interact most heavily with, this has the potential to be the biggest bottleneck. For that reason, this can be considered one, if not the most, critical part of the Operating System for programs.
