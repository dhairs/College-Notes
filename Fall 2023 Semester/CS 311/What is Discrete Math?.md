- The part of math that's more on the discrete/discontinuous objects, things like:
  - Integers
  - Permutations
  - Probability

**Logic**
**Two**-valued logic system

- True statements
- False statements

We can't know all possible truths/falses, ex: the SSN of the POTUS

> P = NP

#### Two laws of classical logic:

**Law of contradiction**

> No statement can be simultaneously true and false

**Law of Excluded Middle**

> Every statement _must_ have a truth value. Must be either true or false.
