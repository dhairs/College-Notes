A proof is an argument that applies one or more 
- sound reasoning methods to a collection of
	- facts, definitions, premises to produce a conclusion that must be true whenever the premises are true

Proofs establish the validity of statements of the following form:

(premise, $\wedge$ premise$_2$, $\ldots$ , $\wedge$ premise$_n$ $\rightarrow$ conclusion) $\equiv$ T ^45a1e8

- "The conclusion follows from the set of premises"
- "The set of premises logically implies the solution"
- "The set of claims entails the solution"
