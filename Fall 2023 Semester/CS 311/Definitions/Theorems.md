A theorem is a statement that can be shown to be true.

## How are theorems stated?
* Many theorem assert that a property holds for all elements in the domain.
* We may have a universal quantifier, but it may not be explicitly stated.
	* Ex: If $x>y$, where $x$ and $y$ are positive real numbers, then $x^2>y^2$
	* What that really means is $(\forall x | x\in\mathbb{R}\wedge x>0: (\forall y | y\in\mathbb{R}\wedge y>0: x^2>y^2))$
