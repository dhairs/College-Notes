A proof is a valid argument that establishes the truth of a statement.

In Math and CS, we mostly use **informal proofs**.


## Why proofs in CS?
* To prove your program to be correct
* Dijkstra "Testing shows the presence of bugs, not its absence"
* To establish your OS is secure
* To prove your algorithm gives you the correct answer
* To show your system specifications are consistent

## Tools in our "Proof" Toolbox
* The Rules of Inference allow us to preserve truth.
* We must *begin* with the truth
* We must start with premises that are true.
* To prove a mathematical statement, we will need the following tools
	* definitions 
	* [[Theorems |Theorem]] - A statement that can be shown to be true
	* axioms - Statements we assume to be true
	* lemma - A helping theorem or result which is needed to prove a theorem
	* proof - A valid argument that establishes the truth of a theorem
	* corollary - A theorem that can be established directly from a theorem
	* conjecture - A statement that is proposed to be true, usually on the basis of some partial evidence or intuition of an expert. When proof is found, the conjecture becomes a theorem.
