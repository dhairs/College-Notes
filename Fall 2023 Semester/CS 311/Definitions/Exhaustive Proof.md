## Definition
This is a type of [[Proof by Cases]]
![[Proof by Cases#Definition]]

- Some theorems can be proved by examining a small number of examples
- We call this exhaustive proofs
- Better for computers, but even those have limits
### Example: Prove that $(n+1)^3≥3^n$ if $n$ is a positive integer such that $n≤4$
