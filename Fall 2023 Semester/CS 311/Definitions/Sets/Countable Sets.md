# Definition
All finite sets are countable sets
If the infinite set has the same cardinality as $\mathbb{Z}^+$, the set is said to be **countable**, denoted by $\aleph_o$
If the infinite set has a different cardinality than $\mathbb{Z}^+$, then it is **uncountable**
**KNOW THAT $\mathbb{R}$ IS UNCOUNTABLE**

$|\mathbb{R}| > |\mathbb{Z}^+|$

$|\mathbb{R}| = |P(\mathbb{Z}^+)| = 2^{\aleph_0} = \aleph_1$

$\aleph_0<\aleph_1<\aleph_2$

No such set $A$ such that $\aleph_0<|A|<\aleph_1$

Set of programs countable

function $f$ is computable if there exists a computer program that finds the value of $f$ for some input

# Examples of Countable Sets
- Odd positive integers $f: \mathbb{Z}^+\to O^+$
- Even positive integers f:
- Even negative integers: $\begin{align}1\leftrightarrow -2 \\ 2\leftrightarrow -4\\ \vdots\end{align}$
