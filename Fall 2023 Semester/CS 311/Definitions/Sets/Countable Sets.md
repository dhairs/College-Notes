# Definition
All finite sets are countable sets
If the infinite set has the same cardinality as $\mathbb{Z}^+$, the set is said to be **countable**, denoted by $\aleph_o$
If the infinite set has a different cardinality than $\mathbb{Z}^+$, then it is **uncountable**

# Examples of Countable Sets
- Odd positive integers $f: \mathbb{Z}^+\to O^+$
- Even positive integers f:
- Even negative integers: $\begin{align}1\leftrightarrow -2 \\ 2\leftrightarrow -4\\ \vdots\end{align}$
