If we can show that $q$ is always true then we can say $p\to q$ is true.

### Example: Let $P(n)$ be "if $a$ and $b$ are non-negative integers and $a≥b$, then $a^n≥b^n$. Show that $P(0)$ is true.
* What is the domain? Non-negative integers (includes zero)
* We need to show $P(0) is true, in other words, "if $a$ and $b$ are non-negative integers and $a≥b$, then $a^0≥b^0$."

Let's do an [[Equivalence-Style Proofs|equivalence style proof]]:

$$
\begin{split}
a^0≥b^0 \\ 
\equiv\, <algebra> \\
1 ≥ 1 \\
\equiv\, <algebra> \\
T
\end{split}
$$


The conclusion is always true regardless of what the values of a and b are. Therefore, P(0) is always true.
