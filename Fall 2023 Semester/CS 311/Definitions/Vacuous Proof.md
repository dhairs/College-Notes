If $p$ is false, then $p\to q$ is *always* true.

### Example: Prove $P(n)$ where $P(n)$ is "If $n$ is an integer with $10≤n≤15$, which is a perfect square then $n$ is a perfect cube."

#### Proof:
$n$ is both $10≤n≤15$
There are no perfect squares between 10 and 15
$\therefore$ the statement that $n$ is an integer with $10≤n≤15$, which is a perfect square, then $n$ is false for all integers $n$.
$\therefore P(n)$ is true for all integers $n$.
