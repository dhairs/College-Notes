## Definition

If we can show that $p$ is *always* false, then $p\to q$ is *always* true. ^903926

## Example: Prove $P(n)$ where $P(n)$ is "If $n$ is an integer with $10≤n≤15$, which is a perfect square then $n$ is a perfect cube."

### Proof:
$n$ is both $10≤n≤15$
There are no perfect squares between 10 and 15
$\therefore$ the statement that $n$ is an integer with $10≤n≤15$, which is a perfect square, then $n$ is false for all integers $n$.
$\therefore P(n)$ is true for all integers $n$.


*note: this one lowkey explained mad weirdly, i'd recommend just watching a youtube video on it*: [Vacuous Proofs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2McxDt9n_I&pp=ygUNdmFjdW91cyBwcm9vZg%3D%3D)
