## Examples of Badly Formed Formulae

1. $\wedge p q$ - connector should be between
2. $p\neg q$ - needs a connector

## Rules

### Part 1:

T, F, P, etc. is a valid proposition.

### Part 2:

If $X$ and $Y$ are propositions, then $\neg X$, $X\wedge Y$, $X\vee Y$ $X\to Y$, and $X\leftrightarrow Y$ are well formed formulae (WFF).

## Example

Let's say we have $p$ and $q$ and $r$ which are valid propositions
and $p\to q$
as a result, $(p\to q)\wedge r$ is a WFF.
