A proof is a valid argument that establishes the truth of a statement/

In Math and CS, we mostly use **informal proofs**.

Why proofs in CS?
* To prove your program to be correct
* Dijkstra "Testing shows the presence of bugs, not its absence"
* To establish your OS is secure
* To prove your algorithm gives you the correct answer
* To show your system specifications are consistent
