**Atomic Proposition**: propositions that cannot be expressed in terms of smaller propositions (literally like atoms)

**Compound Propositions**: The opposite of atomic propositions, they are formed from existing propositions _using_ [[Logical operators|logical operators]]. ^4bae64

**Tautology**: When a compound proposition returns all trues regardless of the variables ^502eb0

**Contradiction**: When a compound proposition returns all false regardless of the variables.

**Contingency**: When there is a mix of true and false in the output of a compound proposition.

**Satisfiability**: If there is any possible truth outcome, the proposition is satisfiable. A compound proposition is satisfiable if there is some assignment of truth value to it such that the compound proposition is true.

**Antecedent**: Easiest to explain is with an example. In $(p\wedge q) \implies p$, the antecedent is $(p\wedge q)$.
