An easy way to display the truth values of a compound proposition.

One row for each possible value of the elementary position.

Truth Tables have $2^n$ rows, where N is the number of unique variables ($p$, $q$, etc.)

| p   | q   | $\neg p$ | $p\wedge q$ | $p\vee q$ |
| --- | --- | -------- | ----------- | --------- |
| T   | T   | F        | T           | T         |
| T   | F   | F        | F           | T         |
| F   | T   | T        | F           | T         |
| F   | F   | T        | F           | F         |

Truth tables can also be used to [prove](Proofs%20Using%20Truth%20Tables.md) [](Discrete%20Math%20Terminology.md#^4bae64|compound%20propositions).
