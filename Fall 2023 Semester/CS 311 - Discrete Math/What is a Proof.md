A [proof](Proofs.md) is an argument that applies one or more

- sound reasoning methods to a collection of
  - facts, definitions, premises to produce a conclusion that must be true whenever the premises are true

Proofs establish the validity of statements of the following form:

(premise, $\wedge$ premise$_2$, $\ldots$ , $\wedge$ premise$_n$ $\rightarrow$ conclusion) $\equiv$ T ^45a1e8

- "The conclusion follows from the set of premises"
- "The set of premises logically implies the solution"
- "The set of claims entails the solution"

There are multiple ways to write a proof:

1. Equivalence Style Proofs ![](Equivalence-Style%20Proofs.md#^b052a7)
2. Truth Table Proofs ![](Proofs%20Using%20Truth%20Tables.md#^d6ec52)
