A proof is a valid argument that establishes the truth of a statement.

In Math and CS, we mostly use **informal proofs**.

## Why proofs in CS?

- To prove your program to be correct
- Dijkstra "Testing shows the presence of bugs, not its absence"
- To establish your OS is secure
- To prove your algorithm gives you the correct answer
- To show your system specifications are consistent

## Tools in our "Proof" Toolbox

- The Rules of Inference allow us to preserve truth.
- We must _begin_ with the truth
- We must start with premises that are true.
- To prove a mathematical statement, we will need the following tools
  - [Definitions](Definitions.md)
  - [Theorem](Theorems.md) - A statement that can be shown to be true
  - axioms - Statements we assume to be true
  - lemma - A helping theorem or result which is needed to prove a theorem
  - proof - A valid argument that establishes the truth of a theorem
  - corollary - A theorem that can be established directly from a theorem
  - conjecture - A statement that is proposed to be true, usually on the basis of some partial evidence or intuition of an expert. When proof is found, the conjecture becomes a theorem.
