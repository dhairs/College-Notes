For derivatives, remember
High $\mathrm{d}x$ Low $-$ Low $\mathrm{d}x$ High over ${Low}^2$

Ex: for the derivative:

### $\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}$

The derivative would be written as:

#### Problem 1

### $\int\limits_{e}^{e^4}$

DO NOT WRITE BOTH U AND X IN THE SAME INTEGRAL
