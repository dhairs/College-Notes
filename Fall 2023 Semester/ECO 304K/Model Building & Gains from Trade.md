#### Modeling

Models are simplistic but emphasize and highlight key concepts.

Condition of **ceteris paribus**. Basically, we change only one variable and keep everything else constant when updating models.

We judge models by seeing how well they work in **real life**.

- **Endogenous Variables** - internal
- **Exogenous Variables** - external

$W=f (Education (positive), Age (positive or negative), Experience (positive), Skills (positive), Pleasant\;Conditions (negative), Female (depends))$
